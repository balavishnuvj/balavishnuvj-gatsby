Authenticating users is one of the basic features that we implement in almost
every meaningful applications we build. It is one of the most important parts of
any application, because of its security implications.

It is hard to get authentication right. So unless you are solving just for
authentication, don't build it yourself. You can pick services that provide
authentication as a service like [magic](https://magic.link/),
[Auth0](https://auth0.com/), etc. If you want to host it yourself, most likely
there would frameworks/libraries that are well maintained for the language you
are using. If you go with the latter approach, you would have to manage the
token somehow.

Basic authentication flow works like this.

```sh no-line-numbers
‚Äã
          +--------------------+            +-------------------+
          |        Client      +------------+      Server       |
          +--------------------+            +-------------------+

          ‚û°Ô∏è    1. Request with credentials like username/password or tokens(refresh)

          ‚¨ÖÔ∏è    2. Response with token

          ‚û°Ô∏è    3. Subsequent requests with token

          ‚¨ÖÔ∏è    4. Validate the token and respond

```

Until the token expires, we keep the user authenticated.

After it expires, we have some mechanism to update the token based on the auth
provider we use. eg.

- you might have to provide the auth details again
- re-new based on the`refresh tokens`
- never expire the token

In all above situations we need to store the token somewhere. That is the
challenge we face. Where do we store the token securely and send it back to the
server?

These are two common choices and both of them have their pros and cons.

1. Storage (Local/Session)
2. Cookies

While using `localstorage`, the data stored in them can be accessed from
client-side JavaScript. Which would mean, if for some reason, our `window`
object is exposed, we give out a token to make authenticated requests. But with
`Storage` the token is never sent "automatically" by the browser.

When it comes to `Cookies`, it kind of the opposite of `Storage`. We would be
talking about `httpOnly` cookies otherwise, even cookies would be accessible
from client-side JavaScript and it would be sent automatically. Making it a bad
choice. With `httpOnly` cookies and marked as `SameSite`, these cookies would be
sent automatically by the browser, but from client-side it wouldn't be
accessible.

**So why is automatically sending cookies bad?**

Since, token it automatically sent by the browser, any link to the site you are
authenticated would give out information that only you should have access.

Let us assume you have logged into `https://TrustedSiteIHaveLoggedIn.com/` ‚úÖ.
And you accidentally clicked a link in a mail which took you to
`http://iwouldstealyourinfo.com/` ‚ùå.

`http://iwouldstealyourinfo.com/ ‚ùåü§´` has a link in their page
`https://TrustedSiteIHaveLoggedIn.com/my-secret-infoü§ê` will give out all the
secret from the site you logged into.

Some precautions taken to avoid such issues are Same Origin Policy (CORS).
Recent releases of modern browsers also include `SameSite` in cookies which
prevent the browser from automatically sending the cookie if it was not to be
issued to the same domain.

Another problem is if a `GET` request is state changing. What it means is, the
request would change something in your backend.

For eg. if you get a mail with link to a legit site
`https://TrustedSiteIHaveLoggediIn.com/transfer-all-money?to=GREEDY_GUY&amount=9999999`.
This link is a bad design, though "attacker" might not have access to your
information they will be able to take actions through URLs. So to prevent such
issues, don't design any APIs which take an action through `GET` requests.

For state-changing requests like POST, just clicking browser makes `GET`
request, so that gets prevented. Also, CSRF acts as additional security. As you
send the additional token to make requests like `POST`

**Why is accessing token from client-side JavaScript bad?**

If a client-side JavaScript has access to the your token, any backdoor to access
them like a `window` exposed by a bad external link.

E.g., it could happen if opening different site without explicitly preventing it
by giving `noopener noreferrer` in your `<a>` tags or `window.open`.

In such cases, the third-party site can have access to your `window`. Which has
access to `localStorage`, so does the token you have saved in the token.

**So where should you keep the token?**

If you are not sure about authentication, please don't implement by yourself. It
is an important part of any application you build. It has to be secure. If you
can use third-party services, then use them. Here you don't have many options on
how or where to store these tokens.

If not, almost all frameworks/languages will have a reputed library to handle
authentication. For NodeJS, it would be
[passportjs](http://www.passportjs.org/). In these implementations, you have the
option of where to store these tokens.

I would recommend storing all long-living tokens (like session ids, refresh
tokens) in `Cookie` with `httpOnly` and `SameSite` enabled. As additional
security, based on the application and the library/module you are using you can
enable CSRF.

For short-living tokens, don't store them to any storage. Since they are active
only for a few minutes (usually, 1-2mins), can be stored in a variable in your
code.

I know I would be repeating myself üôä, If you are not confident or you have no
experience in building authentication for applications. Avoid implementing
yourself, use some service or library.

**Keep your application and your user's information safe.**

Shortened URLs are easier to remember, which enables you to share them with
anyone without having to look at your notes or your bookmarks.

They generally solve two main problems. One, you will not have to remember long
URLs when you want to share. Other is to reduce the length of your URLs while
sending marketing messages.

Suppose I want to share my Twitter profile,
[bala.at/twitter](https://bala.at/twitter) would go to
[https://twitter.com/vjbalavishnu](https://twitter.com/vjbalavishnu). Let's say
in the future if I decided not to use Twitter I can redirect `bala.at/twitter`
to `https://balavishnuvj.com/blog/why-i-left-twitter`, explaining why I stopped
using Twitter.

It would also help in reducing the length of the URLs, where every character in
the message is charged.

Also, the links would look much cleaner. e.g., `bala.at/p/1234` than
`https://example.com/profile/1234`. Having your custom domain would improve
credibility when you share URLs

I was inspired by [Kent's](https://kentcdodds.com/)
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HL6paXyx6hM) on creating shortener using
Netlify.

Let's see how we can build custom URL shortener. You would need

1. GitHub Account
2. Netlify Account
3. Custom Domain (optional)

Netlify provides a simple way to define your redirects, called Netlify
redirects.

All you would need to get started is a repo with a file called `_redirects`.
This file would have the map between your short URL and actual URL.

We can start by creating a new repo in your GitHub account. I have named it
`netlify-redirects`. Lets create a file `_redirects` with some config.

```
/github     https://github.com/balavishnuvj
/twitter    https://twitter.com/vjbalavishnu
/linkedin   https://www.linkedin.com/in/balavishnuvj

/*          https://balavishnuvj.com/
```

The left-hand side would be a short link and the right-hand side would be the
full link.

Let‚Äôs deploy this repo in netlify. You can do that by going to
[Netlify](https://app.netlify.com). In the site section, add new site by
clicking `New site from Git`. If you haven't authorized netlify before, give
netlify the permission to access your repo. As soon as access is granted, your
work is nearly done.

Once deployed (will not take more than a few seconds ‚ö°Ô∏è), you can go back to
[Netlify](https://app.netlify.com). Under the site section, you would find a
site with `<random-text>.netlify.app`.

Your "shortener" is working, can test it by going to `<random-text>.netlify.app`
or `<random-text>.netlify.app/github` or any other custom links you provided.

Now this isn't as short as we wanted, Netlify allows us to edit the subdomain
name, so you can do that by going to
`Domain Settings -> Options(under <radom-text>) -> Edit Site Name`. I had
changed mine from `<random-text>.netlify.app` to
`netlify-redirects.netlify.app`. You will not be able to use the same, but you
can pick something that makes sense to you. Maybe `qwe.netlify.app`, something
like that.

Now we have even shorter domain `qwe.netlify.app` and `qwe.netlify.app/github`
takes us to desired page.

To make the domain name even shorter, we will have to buy a custom domain. I got
mine [bala.at](https://bala.at) from [iwantmyname](https://iwantmyname.com), you
can get it from netlify or anywhere you can find the domain name you are
looking.

Once you have bought the domain, you have to change the domain name server to
what netlify would provide in `Domain Settings -> Add custom domain`.

You would have to copy the name servers from **Netlify** to the domain name
provider.

**NOTE: It might take few hours for the name servers to get updated**

So you might want to wait for a couple of hours if your custom domain doesn't
work.

To make things easier to add new URLs to your repo, Kent has created a package
[netlify-shortener](https://github.com/kentcdodds/netlify-shortener). It has
util to add shortener from your terminal.

```bash
npm run shorten # simply formats your _redirects file
npm run shorten https://yahoo.com # generates a short code and adds it for you
npm run shorten https://github.com gh # adds gh as a short URL for you
```

_From the original
[documentation](https://github.com/kentcdodds/netlify-shortener#usage) of
netlify-shortener._

There are few shortcomings with this approach of building a custom URL
shortener. If you want the same URL for all the users you are good to go. e.g.,
[bala.at/twitter](https://bala.at/twitter) should go to
[https://twitter.com/vjbalavishnu](https://twitter.com/vjbalavishnu). But what
if you require a unique one for each user? e.g., You want users‚Äô to be able to
share their profile. Let's see the actual URL would look like
`https://example.com/profile/<user-id>`. We will not be able to generate unique
URLs for each user. But we can forward URL params to the actual URL. We use
[splats](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/redirect-options/#splats) or
[placeholders](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/redirect-options/#placeholders)
from netlify.

```
/p/*      https://example.com/profile/:splat
```

We have prefixed all URLs that have to go to `profile` to `p`. So now
`bala.at/p/1234` should take to `https://example.com/profile/1234`.

Analytics is one of USP for most of the URL shorteners, we won‚Äôt be able to do
that here, but you can add analytics to your webserver that should handle most
of your use cases.

Yup, that's all. We have our custom domain URL shortener. üï∫

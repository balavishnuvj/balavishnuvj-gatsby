It is always advised to have a single source of truth for your application.
Before we start, let's see what exactly the state of the application is.

`State` is part of the application that holds a source of data. It could be your
database like `Table`, `Document` or React states like `useState` or
`useReducer`.

## Single Source of Truth

Any time you query for data, it should be fulfilled by a unique set of `State`.
For eg. If you ask for **List of all users who have commented on a post**, you
should get a list of users from set tables such that this information is not
replicated in any other data.

```sql
select *
from users u
inner join post_comments pc on pc.user_id = u.user_id
where pc.post_id = 1
```

Here, we are querying from two tables, `users` and `post_comments`. This is
fine, as none of the information is repeated;

### Examples where you might not have a single source of truth

There might be a lot of cases where we might not be having a single source of
truth. It could be an _aggregate table_, a _caching_, a _copying data from
source props_, or _requesting data from an AJAX request_. In all of these
instances, we are copying data from one source to another. There are many other
instances where you might be doing the same.

But if you had created an aggregate table, `users_comments`, which has all the
comments of a given user, then we will have two sources of data for the same
query.

```sql
/* Query 1 */
select *
from users u
inner join post_comments pc on pc.user_id = u.user_id
where pc.post_id = 1

/* Query 2 */
select *
from users_comments
where post_id = 1
```

Essentially both `Query 1` and `Query 2` are returning the same data.

**Another example**

```js
function NumberList() {
  const [numbers, setNumbers] = useState()
  return <Child state={state} />
}

function EvenNumbers({ numbers }) {
  const [evenNumbers, setEvenNumbers] = useState()
  useEffect(() => {
    setEvenNumbers(numbers.filter(filterEvenNumbers))
  }, [numbers])
}
```

Let's say we have a list of numbers, and we want to filter out the numbers that
are even in the `EvenNumbers` component.

Here, `evenNumbers` copied from `numbers`, But there is a possibility that these
sources can diverge in the future. Maybe a bug in code, you come infrastructure
outage caused write in one of the tables failed.

**There is nothing that ensures `numbers` and `evenNumbers` hold the same source
of truth.** You might be thinking `useEffect` ensures that. But it is not. It is
creating a copy of data, there is no check to make sure that `useEffect` is not
removed in the future.

### For eg.

When `numbers` was `null` our code broke, so add a check to make sure that if it
is null then copy doesn't happen.

```diff
function NumberList() {
  const [numbers, setNumbers] = useState()
  return <Child state={state} />
}

function EvenNumbers({ numbers }) {
  const [evenNumbers, setEvenNumbers] = useState()
  useEffect(() => {
+   if(!state) return
    setEvenNumbers(numbers.filter(filterEvenNumbers))
  }, [numbers])
}
```

**But this introduces a new problem.** In this example, lets say `numbers` is
`[2]` and we sync it to `evenNumbers` so it will be `[2]`. Now, let us update
the `numbers` to `null`. Now because of the check we introduced in `useEffect`,
`copyState` will be `[2]` and state will be `null`. Our state is **not in
sync**.

### Syncing state

Whenever you have an observer listening to data and it updating another source
of data. Then it is called _syncing data_. For eg. in our above react example,
we are syncing using `useEffect`. In _caching_ it could be our cache
invalidation logic, in the case of _aggregate_ table, it could the triggers.

By definition, we have a separate function to sync data. This implies that there
is a possibility that our sync logic might not run. It could be because some
developers decided to add some logic to sync data.

If possible we should be deriving data from the source instead of copying data.
For eg.

```diff
function NumberList() {
  const [numbers, setNumbers] = useState()
  return <Child state={state} />
}

function EvenNumbers({ numbers }) {
-  const [evenNumbers, setEvenNumbers] = useState()
+ const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(filterEvenNumbers);
-  useEffect(() => {
-   if(!state) return
-    setEvenNumbers(numbers.filter(filterEvenNumbers))
-  }, [numbers])
}
```

## Avoid copying state

- Avoid copying state, instead derive state from the source. Copying introduce a
  latent bug.
- If you have to copy state, make sure that you have additional checks to make
  sure sync is happening.

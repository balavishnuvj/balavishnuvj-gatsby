} from "./components.jsx"

All most applications we build have some form of dynamic UI. Where user
interacts with the app, and then we create/update/delete elements in the app. We
use `React State` to store dynamic values. And our interactions update the
`state`, which updates our UI. But we need to be a bit careful when we store
these dynamic UIs (React Elements) in state instead of storing just the data
required to render React Elements.

Letâ€™s see what could go wrong using our favorite example, **ToDo** list app.
Where we can just add some ToDo's (For sake a simplicity, ToDo's are generated
randomly).

<TodoListV1 />

_You can click on "Add ToDo" to create your ToDo list_

```jsx
function TodoList() {
  const [todos, setTodos] = React.useState([])
  function handleAddTodo() {
    setTodos([
      ...todos,
      <Todo key={todos.length} text={generateRandomTodo()} />,
    ])
  }
  return (
    <CodeDemo>
      <ul style={{ padding: "10px" }}>{todos}</ul>
      <button onClick={handleAddTodo}>Add ToDo</button>
    </CodeDemo>
  )
}
```

Here, we are appending the component `<Todo />` to the state `todos`. Do you see
any potenial bug here? If you do then awesome ðŸ•º, let see how we can solve it in
this blog.

If you weren't able to see any bug, you can try to add some more features to
discover the bug. Letâ€™s add a way to delete a ToDo.

<TodoListV2 />

---

```diff
  function handleAddTodo() {
    setTodos([
      ...todos,
      <Todo
        key={todos.length}
        text={generateRandomTodo()}
+       onDelete={() => handleDelete(todos.length)}
      />,
    ])
  }
```

To discover the bug, you can try to adding three ToDos and then delete the
second one. You might see that you are deleting the second ToDo, but it is
deleting the third one too.

To inspect what is happening, we can add logs to our `handleDelete` function. We
see that when are deleting the second item, the index is `1` as expected. But
the `todos` just has two items, it should have been three.

```jsx {4-7,15}
function TodoList() {
  const [todos, setTodos] = React.useState([])

  function handleDelete(index) {
    console.log("handleDelete", { index, todos })
    setTodos(todos.filter((_, i) => i !== index))
  }

  function handleAddTodo() {
    setTodos([
      ...todos,
      <Todo
        key={todos.length}
        text={generateRandomTodo()}
        onDelete={() => handleDelete(todos.length)}
      />,
    ])
  }
  return (
    <CodeDemo>
      <ul style={{ padding: "10px" }}>{todos}</ul>
      <button onClick={handleAddTodo}>Add ToDo</button>
    </CodeDemo>
  )
}
```

**We have a closure** bug here, so we can see that the `todos` has the value
when `() => handleDelete(index)` was created for the second item. At that moment
`todos` had only two items. So we can fix that by using the state setter
function.

```diff
  function handleDelete(index) {
-   setTodos(todos.filter((_, i) => i !== index))
+   setTodos(currentTodos => currentTodos.filter((_, i) => i !== index))
  }
```

<TodoListV3 />

Oh! awesome, we have fixed the bug. But we have a problem. If you try adding
another ToDo, after deleting you see that we get a warning from React that there
are duplicate keys. But for now let it be ðŸ¤·.

Letâ€™s add another feature to our ToDo app. We want our users to be a bit careful
when the delete a ToDo. Letâ€™s introduce **delete mode**. They can only delete
ToDo's if they are in delete mode.

```jsx {3,6-9,25-33}
function TodoList() {
  const [todos, setTodos] = React.useState([])
  const [isDeleteMode, setIsDeleteMode] = React.useState(false)

  function handleDelete(index) {
    if (!isDeleteMode) {
      alert("Please enable delete mode first")
      return
    }
    setTodos(currentTodos => currentTodos.filter((_, i) => i !== index))
  }

  function handleAddTodo() {
    setTodos([
      ...todos,
      <Todo
        key={todos.length}
        text={generateRandomTodo()}
        onDelete={() => handleDelete(todos.length)}
      />,
    ])
  }
  return (
    <CodeDemo>
      <div>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          checked={isDeleteMode}
          onChange={() => setIsDeleteMode(!isDeleteMode)}
          id="deleteMode1"
        ></input>
        <label htmlFor="deleteMode1"> Enable Delete Mode</label>
      </div>

      <ul style={{ padding: "10px" }}>{todos}</ul>
      <button onClick={handleAddTodo}>Add ToDo</button>
    </CodeDemo>
  )
}
```

<TodoListV4 />

Oh no! We have a bug here. We can see that when we delete a ToDo, we are getting
an alertðŸš¨ saying **Please enable delete mode first**. Even though we have
enabled the delete mode. When we debug we see that the `isDeleteMode` is
`false`. This is the same bug as before ðŸ¤¦. Our `isDeleteMode` is not being
updated. It is same as when the `() => handleDelete(index)` was created by
`handleAddTodo`.

Our earlier fix only worked, when `handleDelete` was only dependent on one state
`todos`. But now it dependent on two states, `isDeleteMode` and `todos`.

To fix this, we will have to re-create `() => handleDelete(index)` when
`isDeleteMode` changes. But that will only solve the problem for now. If
`handleDelete` has more dependency, then our current fix will break.

Letâ€™s fix this once in for all. We will refactor it a bit, instead of `todos`
keeping the React elements, let it just hold the data required to render the
element.

```diff
.
.

  function handleAddTodo() {
-   setTodos([
-     ...todos,
-     <Todo
-       key={todos.length}
-       text={generateRandomTodo()}
-       onDelete={() => handleDelete(todos.length)}
-     />,
-   ])
+   setTodos([...todos, { text: generateRandomTodo() }])
  }

.
.

- <ul style={{ padding: "10px" }}>{todos}</ul>
+ <ul style={{ padding: "10px" }}>
+   {todos.map((todo, index) => (
+     <Todo
+       key={index}
+       onDelete={() => handleDelete(index)}
+       text={todo.text}
+     />
+   ))}
+ </ul>
.
.
```

<TodoListV5 />

**Bonus**

Our `key` for `Todo` is not unique. We can fix that by using `id` instead of
using `index`. We need any unique identifier while creating todo. We could use
the current time. But that is not always good, if the backend is saving this
data, let the backend create this ID for you. But for now the current date time
works fine.

<TodoListV6 />

---

Here is our final solution. We have a unique ID for each ToDo. We can use that
to delete our ToDo too.

```jsx
function TodoList() {
  const [todos, setTodos] = React.useState([])
  const [isDeleteMode, setIsDeleteMode] = React.useState(false)

  function handleDelete(idToDelete) {
    if (!isDeleteMode) {
      alert("Please enable delete mode first")
      return
    }
    setTodos(currentTodos =>
      currentTodos.filter(todo => todo.id !== idToDelete)
    )
  }

  function handleAddTodo() {
    setTodos([
      ...todos,
      { text: generateRandomTodo(), id: new Date().getTime() },
    ])
  }

  return (
    <CodeDemo>
      <div>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          checked={isDeleteMode}
          onChange={() => setIsDeleteMode(!isDeleteMode)}
          id="deleteMode"
        ></input>
        <label htmlFor="deleteMode"> Enable Delete Mode</label>
      </div>

      <ul style={{ padding: "10px" }}>
        {todos.map(todo => (
          <Todo
            key={todo.id}
            onDelete={() => handleDelete(todo.id)}
            text={todo.text}
          />
        ))}
      </ul>
      <button onClick={handleAddTodo}>Add ToDo</button>
    </CodeDemo>
  )
}
```

Well, that fixes our bugs. To make sure that we don't add these bugs later, you
can learn about writing tests for them from
